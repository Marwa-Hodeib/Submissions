    <h2>Understanding Puberty</h2>
    <p>
      While you’re busy getting to grips with secondary school, new friendships
      and more homework,<br />
      your body is growing and physiologically changing from a child to a
      woman.<br />
      This is ‘puberty’ and can make your early teens an unsettling and
      challenging time. You’ll notice hair starting to grow on your body; your
      periods will start; your moods may feel a little out of control; you may
      start to sweat more. It’s all perfectly normal but nevertheless these
      changes can be worrying.<br />

      <br />There are no hard and fast rules about when all this growing and
      changing will happen, or to what extent. Some girls develop breasts much
      earlier than others do; some have more body hair than others; some people
      never have a spot in their life but others have loads. The important thing
      to remember is that you’re not the only person this is happening to and
      that everyone is different.<br />

      <br />The physical changes during puberty used to be discussed rather
      secretively – friends might have exchanged snippets of information that
      wasn’t necessarily correct; mothers may have had an awkward conversation
      with their daughters – and mental developments were barely acknowledged.
      It was certainly never discussed in school lessons. Luckily things have
      improved and schools are now much better at explaining the physical and
      mental changes that you can expect. There are also some excellent and
      reliable sources of information.<br />

      <br />Please do not feel guilty if you are embarrassed by the changes that
      are happening to you, or if you don’t feel like discussing them – they are
      very personal and private. The main thing is not to worry in private. Most
      things you will experience are perfectly normal and, even if you do not
      want to talk to anyone, we should be able to reassure you or guide you to
      useful information. We will also tell you when you should see a doctor. If
      that is the case, try not to worry.
