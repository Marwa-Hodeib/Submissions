          School bans students from wearing hoodies because they ‘can be
          intimidating’
        </h2>
        <p>
          A secondary school has banned its pupils
        </p>
        <p>
          from wearing hoodies because they “can be quite intimidating” and make
          students “hard to identify”.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the current school term, Brune Park Community School in
          Gosport, Hampshire implemented a new uniform policy outlining that
          students are no longer allowed to wear hoodies to school.
        </p>

        <p>
          Part of the reasoning behind the ban, which has sparked a backlash
          among pupils, was to make it easier to identify students during break
          time and to prevent teenagers from wearing garments emblazoned with
          “inappropriate” imagery.
        </p>

        <p>
          “When you have large 15 and 16 year olds wandering round in hoodies it
          can be quite intimidating, particularly for younger pupils,” said Mike
          Jones, deputy headteacher of the academic institution.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Some of these hoodies also have inappropriate images such as cannabis
          plants which creates the wrong impression.”
