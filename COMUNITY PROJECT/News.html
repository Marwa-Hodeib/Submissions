      School bans students from wearing hoodies because they ‘can be
      intimidating’
    </h3>

    <p>
      A secondary school has banned its pupils from wearing hoodies because they
      “can be quite intimidating” and make students “hard to identify”.<br />

      <br />During the current school term, Brune Park Community School in
      Gosport, Hampshire implemented a new uniform policy outlining that
      students are no longer allowed to wear hoodies to school.<br />

      <br />Part of the reasoning behind the ban, which has sparked a backlash
      among pupils, was to make it easier to identify students during break time
      and to prevent teenagers from wearing garments emblazoned with
      “inappropriate” imagery.<br />

      <br />“When you have large 15 and 16 year olds wandering round in hoodies
      it can be quite intimidating, particularly for younger pupils,” said Mike
      Jones, deputy headteacher of the academic institution.<br />

      <br />“Some of these hoodies also have inappropriate images such as
      cannabis plants which creates the wrong impression.”
