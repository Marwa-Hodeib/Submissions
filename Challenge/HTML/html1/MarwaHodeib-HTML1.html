  <h2>what is Dun dun?</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Dun dun </b>is the generic name for a family of West African drums <br />
    that have developed alongside the djembe in the
    <mark>Mande drum ensemble</mark>.<br />
    A dunun is a rope-tuned cylindrical drum with a rawhide skin at both
    ends,<br />
    most commonly cow or goat. The drum is played with a <i>stick.</i>
  </p>
  <h3>How is it played?</h3>
  <p>
    Traditionally, the drum is played horizontally <br />
    (placed on a stand or worn with a shoulder strap). <br />
    For a right-handed player, the right hand plays the skin <br />
    and the left hand optionally plays a bell that may be mounted <br />
    on top of the drum or held in the left hand. <br />
    The latter style is popular in Mali and originally from the
    <b>Khassonké people.</b>
