        Another woman by the name of Massoumeh Darabpour has been identified<br />
        in the new list of names of 30 martyrs verified by the People’s
        Mojahedin<br />
        (PMOI/MEK) and the Iranian Resistance.<br />

        Massoumeh Darabpour was killed during the Iran uprising in Ahvaz.<br />
        The total number of verified names of persons killed by security<br />
        forces during the mid-November Iran protests has so far reached 380.<br />

        The Iranian Resistance estimates that the total number of martyrs<br />
        of the Iran Uprising exceeds 1,000. More than 4,000 persons have been<br />
        wounded or injured during the Iran protests, and over 12,000 persons<br />
        have been arrested. The wave of arbitrary arrests continues across the
        country.

        At a press briefing on December 5, 2019, Brian Hook, the Special<br />
        Representative for Iran and Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State,<br />
        affirmed the number of deaths in the recent Iran protests may have
        surpassed<br />
        1,000. He added that the regime’s treatment of the Iranian people is
        abhorrent and unacceptable.

        Hook said, “It appears the regime could have murdered over a thousand<br />
        Iranian citizens since the protests began. We cannot be certain
        because<br />
        the regime blocks information. Among those murdered are at least a dozen
        children,<br />
        including 13 and 14-year-olds. We have received reports from family
        members of victims<br />
        who tried to recover the bodies. The authorities demanded that the
        families first pay<br />
        the cost of the bullets they used. In many cases, authorities would not
        hand over the<br />
        bodies until their family promised not to hold public funerals.”
